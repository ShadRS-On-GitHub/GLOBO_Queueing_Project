A list of things that should be added or investigated with more time.

Need to happen:
-Add ReadMe.txt with instructions
-Move various inputs to an input file
-Rework ClientQueue to be an array with mutexes, or modify base Queue to allow the peek
-Add some validation of the CSV file

Unlikely to happen:
-Use an actual testing framework to test out everything
-Client/Server authentication
-Use a Database for the Client Queue
-Consider other networking options, Sockets may not be the best choice
